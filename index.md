### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was a favorite because it was about creating a program that uses user input to create a previously created story with that input and I honestly thought it was fun to make. I feel like I did a lot of coding on this part and this was the first lab I really understood and make me feel like I was competent at coding. It also was one of the very few that worked the first time so that was encouraging.
* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite not because it was easy or anything it was just so rewarding to complete. I think it was a favorite because I was able to finish it and it ran well. I did like the principles and the intro to vectors but the linter gave me so many problems that I was beyond happy to finish this lab.
* Lab 7
    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorites because I just thought it was interesting. The way blackjack is scored is like a perfect subject to write a code about. It was definitely a long lab to complete but I liked the idea behind it and how it applied to a game in real life. I also liked how this was the type of thing that is more ideal for a computer to do than a human like calculating the points of cards that don't change value. I enjoyed coding this and making the if statements in the functions file.
